# webping demo converter
## webping v0.0.1 from some 5 libraries stack
### It convert file to smaller file, usually images

I want to make covertion to .txt, so it is the start of journey and webping is the side-husstle library that can be useful for a lot of fair users. it will be cool to convert tracks 3m + to something better as 1m, so boring to hear something on repeat

it convert to .webp including raw files may be, but require ffmpeg and python with pillow

you can donate me to SBER +79219110831 using SBP
please

You can run in terminal ```python3 ./init.py --input "input_file_path" --output "destination_file_path"``` or **run_file.bat** to convert solo file or push `run.bat` to convert all images from ./input path to ./output
